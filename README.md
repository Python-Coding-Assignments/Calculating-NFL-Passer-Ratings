## About the Project
This program allows the user to compare two NFL football players' statistics.  The will first prompt the user to enter the player statistics for two players of his/her choice.  Afterwards, the program then will calculate the players' passer ratings, and then compare them against each other's rating.

The objective of this program is to demonstrate the following: 
* demonstrate understanding of writing function definitions and calling functions within main
* amalgamate the current acquired knowledge of Python, such as input/output, if/elif/else statements, loops, and functions into one program.
* further practice the basics of Python arithmetic

This program assumes that the user will enter a valid input each time the program requests an integer value.  The program's output will result in unknown behavior if anything other than an integer is entered by the user.  

## Getting Started
To run the program, download the contents of the project and simply run make in the terminal.
